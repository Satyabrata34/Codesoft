                            <p style="color: black;">Aerospace engineering is the 
                                primary field of engineering concerned
                                with the development of aircraft and spacecraft.[3]
                                It has two major and overlapping branches: 
                                aeronautical engineering and astronautical .
                                Avionics engineering is similar, but deals with 
                                the electronics side of aerospace
                                engineering."Aeronautical engineering" was the
                                 original term for the field.
                                As flight technology advanced to include vehicles
                                 operating in outer space, the broader
                                term "aerospace engineering" has come into use.[4]
                                Aerospace engineering, particularly the astronautics
                                 branch, is often colloquially
                                referred to as "rocket science".</p>

                            <h3 style="color: black;">Presidency</h3>
                            <p style="color: black;">Sir Kalam was entitled to 
                                be the 11th president of India.
                                His term period of 25th July 2002 to 25th 
                                July 2007 was achieved by winning a
                                presidential election in 2002 with a massive margin of votes.
                                National Democratic Alliances’ nominated him to 
                                be president and it was supported by
                                Samajwadi Party and National Congress Party.
                                He was lovingly called as peoples’ president as
                                 he had done uncountable works for the
                                welfare of the people and through the entire country.
                                He was brave and courageous enough to take decisions and
                                 implement them no matter if
                                that was tough or sensitive or highly controversial.
                                The “office of profit” is perhaps the hard Act that 
                                he had to sign. The “office of
                                profit”, according to the English Act of Settlement
                                in 1701 explains that no single individual who has a 
                                professional set up under the royal
                                family,
                                who has some kind of provision with or who is taking 
                                a pension from the prince has the
                                right to work for the of the “House of Commons”.
                                This will allow the royal family to have zero influence 
                                on the administrative conditions.
                                He had also become one of the most talked-about 
                                presidents Rule in 2005 for imposing the
                                Presidents’ rule in Bihar.
                                Kalam expressed his wish to take up the position 
                                one more time but then later changed
                                his mind.

                                After taking farewell from the office, he shifted 
                                and commenced his career as a visiting
                                professor at the Indian Institute of Management
                                in Shillong. He served as an Aerospace Engineering 
                                professor at Anna University, Tamil
                                Nadu.
                                He also lit up educational institutions like the 
                                Indian Institute of Indore, Indian
                                Institute of Bangalore with his presence and knowledge.
                                Sir Kalam served as chancellor Indian Institute 
                                of Space Science and Technology,
                                Thiruvananthapuram.

                                In 2012, he introduced a program called “What Can I Give?”
                                focusing on the theme of eradicating corruption from the country. </p>
